Workout Log
===========

Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree project.

This app is intended for users to easily keep track of their gym activities, and also provide image
searching abilities if the user has doubt about how certain activity should be carried out,
e.g. "how should I do a dumbbell chest press?".

The initial page of the app shows all workout activities by the user, sorted by date. Note that this
page will be empty if first using the app. The plus (+) sign on the top-right will allow user to add
new activities, and pressing existing activity will show imagery on its detail.

In "Add an Entry" view, the user can put a date/time of the activity, which defaults to now, which
is handy if the user is curretly at the gym. Then the user can specify an entry name, and search for
corresponding images as instructions, e.g. seated bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, etc. If the
activity has already been added before, they will show up directly rather than retrived from
Internet.

Although initially designed as a workout log, the app can serve as for more general purposes ---
keeping a log of anything users want to with an exact date time and imagery information.
